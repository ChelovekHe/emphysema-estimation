# Dataset-1 #
Derived from Dataset-0 using all features at all scales.

A large dataset generated by sampling a large number of ROIs from each scan in Dataset-0. The dataset is of the same size as the actual dataset that is planned for training.

We plan to use 200 scans and sample 50 ROIs from each scan for training. So we need to generate 1000 ROIs from each of the 10 scans in Dataset-0 to match the size.
